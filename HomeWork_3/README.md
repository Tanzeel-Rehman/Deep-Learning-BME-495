**Part- I:**

In this homework we implemented the standard feedforward network from
scratch. The neural\_network.py includes functions for both forward and
backward passes and updating the learning parameters. The weights are
initialized randomly and are updated using SGD algorithm The
implementation can handle multiple layers.

**Part-II:**

The logic gates API is used to train the four feedforward networks to
solve for the logic gates. The learned weights and biases for AND, OR,
NOT and XOR logic gates can be seen in attached pdf results.
