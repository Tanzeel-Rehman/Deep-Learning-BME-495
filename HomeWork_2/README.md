**Part- I:**

In this homework we implemented the standard feedforward network from
scratch. The neural\_network.py includes functions for only forward pass
at the moment. Weight update and backpropagation will be supported in
next work. The implementation can handle multiple layers.

**Part-II:**

The logic gates API is used to complete the forward pass on manually
adjusted values for AND, OR, NOT and XOR logic gates and apply sigmoid
nonlinearity. See more details in attached pdf file.
